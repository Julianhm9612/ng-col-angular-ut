# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 13. Testing if the service is defined ðŸ¤“

As you may see the service looks more or less similar to our names provider, one of the main differences is the HttpClient giving us the way to do a get request in a pretty straightforward way, similarly we can do get, post, put, delete etc, it is interesting because you can do as much as you need with HTTP Client, the natural return of the HTTP Client is an observable, and right now maybe you can't find too much profit of it, however, later on, we will cover it. Let's review then, how to test this simple service first let's try with the typical structure of the test, the goal is only to test whether the service is defined or not. ðŸ˜‡

For now simply review:
