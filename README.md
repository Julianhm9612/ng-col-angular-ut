# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 7.  Practicing testing promises 🏋️‍💪 🛠

What if the promise failing? 🤔, right now there is not a way to fail the Promise but we can do something experimental by sending the params to the function in order to fail, now it is time to you for writing the test case for the promise when it is failing, review the empty test I have created for you and start adding how it should like, see:

[names.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step7/src/app/names.service.spec.ts)

You only have another 3 minutes to do this, soooo, don't waste time ⏰

## You are done, now go to [Branch #8](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step8)
