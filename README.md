- [conferences.service.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step18/src/app/conferences.service.ts)

- [conferences.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step18/src/app/conferences.service.spec.ts)

## You are done, now go to [Branch #20](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step20)
