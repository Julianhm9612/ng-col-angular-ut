# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 29. Final exercise 👏👏

It has been a long journey until here, so take this exercise as your final exam 🧐 🤓. You should do two things:

1. First is to write the test for the authenticationService which you will find already implemented using a hardcoded validation. 

2. Second, you will notice about a variable in the `loginComponent` called `isLogged` this variable handle a conditional in the view to display the protected content in the view. So your goal is to write the tests for this functionality.

- [login.component.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step29/src/app/login/login.component.ts) 
- [login.component.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step29/src/app/login/login.component.spec.ts)

## You are done, now go to [Branch #30](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step30)
