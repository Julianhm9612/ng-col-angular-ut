# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 18. Practicing with the retry operator 💆‍ 💆‍ (This is a hard one 💪💪)

Retry operator is a powerful tool which gives us the ability to resubscribe to the observable if the HTTP request fails and it tries again, this kind of behavior is for us a challenge because we need to think how we are going to handle this through unit tests. In this exercise you have the goal of rewrite the failing unit test and write a new one when the retry operator works in the last attempt. (Exercise 5).

Don't worry if you don't get it, trust me it is the hardes excersice of the workshop. 💅💅
