# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 10.  Testing dependant functions exercise 🤯

So far, right now we have a way to test simple functions, private properties, promises, and observables, we are creating a strong foundation for our future unit tests. Let's review how we can test dependent functions. It means what happens when a function is called from other function. 

What should be tested here? 🤔

- [names.service.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step10/src/app/names.service.ts)

🙋 Each function independently? 

🙋🙋 Both functions together?

- [names.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step10/src/app/names.service.spec.ts)

No worries, this time you will have 5 minutes to do this, so, take your time,think about it ⏰

## You are done, now go to [Branch #11](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step11)
