# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 23. Let's build a login 👩🏻‍🎨

Good, it is time to build something useful for you. ✅

Let's build a full login to understand a little bit more complex concepts about the components testing, let's add a little login form in our component using bootstrap and importing the forms module. 

I have added some html and offcourse adding the forms module for the app:
- [login.component.html](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/login/login.component.html)

- [app.module.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/app.module.ts)

Nothing to be tested needs to be added in this step, but it is important to ensure the tests are working. 🤐

[app.component.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/app.component.spec.ts)

## You are done, now go to [Branch #24](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step24)
