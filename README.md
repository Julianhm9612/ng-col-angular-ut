# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 4.  Our First Exercise 🏋️‍💪 🛠

Let's start with our first exercise, the idea is to gain muscle and write as many tests as we can, later, we will introduce TDD, but for now let's imagine we have a function which returns us the first element on our names array. You will see the function to test in [names.service.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step4/src/app/names.service.ts) and the test ready to be implemented in [names.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step4/src/app/names.service.spec.ts).

You only have 3 minutes to do this so, don't waste time ⏰

## You are done, now go to [Branch #4](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step5)
