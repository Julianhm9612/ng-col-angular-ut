# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

In this workshop we will learn and practice how to write effective unit tests, covering the fundamentals of the Angular TestBed API and see how writing unit tests in Angular can change our development life. We also will understand the deploy process of a typical Angular application and what is the part of the unit tests over there. The plan for the workshop is, we will cover what is a unit test how to bring them into Angular, then we will see what is the Angular TestBed and how never forget the how to write a test in Angular. Also, we will see how to test providers and components and We will meet the "Do-it-yourself Angular Test framework to facilitate your development life. Next, we will introduce TDD and we can deep into Karma Jasmine and Protractor to definitely you be on the road. A little bit of sugar with e2e tests and finally We will introduce the Angular TestBed (ATB) repository and We will see how to contribute using unit tests to the Angular / Angular TestBed projects.
