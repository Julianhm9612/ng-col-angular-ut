# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 24. Writing a validation TDD 👩🏻‍🎨

Now, what are the fundamental concepts of a login process?, 🙃 

It should vary depend of the context, application or company however there are few common steps: 😯

1. The first part is obviously a way for the user to enter data.
2. Then the data needs to be valid according to some rules to validate in the client side.
3. Later we would need to send the credential to some service and get the answer. 

So, let's focus in the first part: in a typical email/password login, we need to ensure the email is an email, and the password has atleast a simple length rule. So what if this time I give you the tests first and you will create the function to validate the user credentials are right. (Exercise 6).

see the test implemented is here:

- [login.component.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/login/login.component.spec.ts)

and you will need to write the function to pass the test here:

- [login.component.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/login/login.component.ts)


It is a easy one so you only have another 2 minutes to do this, don't waste time ⏰

## You are done, now go to [Branch #25](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step25)
