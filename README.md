# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 9.  Testing observables 🤤

What about observables? 🙄, you will find in many cases that services are intended to return observables instead of promise because all the wave about reactive programing 😏, so let's explore first how to convert a simple data into an observable and then how to tests the observable. You will find the testing strategy is pretty similar than the promises stuff we assert inside the subscription object. Let's Review the:
