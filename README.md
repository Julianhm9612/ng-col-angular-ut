# 17. Power testing Observables CatchError üßô‚Äç (Is it like magic right?)

One of the advantages about the observables in angular is the hability to catch and manage the error in the request. 

üíÅ‚Äç The catchError operator which give us the hability to handle and manage our error in the proper way always returning in an observable way, let's explore strategies about how to test it and what to consider about.
