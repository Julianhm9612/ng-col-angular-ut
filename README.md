# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 21. Testing binding process in components ðŸ‘¥ðŸ‘¥

Now let's go to a very small ðŸ‘Œ and particular case in wich we have a component who bind two times a variable to be rendered in the template. 

We will use the setTimeout to introduce the done function in Jasmine. The important part is the fixture element which allow us to execute the databinding process where available and obviously simulate some delay âŒ›... 

Let's check this out:  [login.component.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/login/login.component.ts) and the [login.component.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step21/src/app/login/login.component.spec.ts)

## You are done, now go to [Branch #22](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step22)
