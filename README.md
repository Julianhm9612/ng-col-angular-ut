In this step in our `onSubmit` method will be called with valid credentials and we are going to check if the `areValidCredentials` method is being called with proper credentials and is not being called with invalid credentials.

- [login.component.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step26/src/app/login/login.component.ts) 
- [login.component.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step26/src/app/login/login.component.spec.ts)

## You are done, now go to [Branch #27](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/tree/step27)
