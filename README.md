# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 27. Learning partial services mock in Login 🕵🏻🕵🏻

Now, We have put the service to handle the authentication process, but it is not the most important part of this. Really we shouldn't care about because first from our test we can handle and determine what are we going to show if the authentication process is a success or not. Second, we need to learn the first way to mock the service from the component and redefine some small flow about. Be careful with the partial the providers.userValue and how to restructure the flow. 💉
