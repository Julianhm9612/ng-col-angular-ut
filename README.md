# Write powerful Unit Tests with Angular Test Bed

# 15. Practicing your power testing HTTP Request ü§ì

It is time to other excercise, this time, the idea is you to practice all the learnings from mocks, providers and HTTP, this excersice could be tricky but it would be great to you by doing it. There is an API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to simulate a POST request. So your challenge is to create the provider, the service, the method and the test to save a "post" inside the jsonplaceholder api, you should call the endpoint POST	/posts --> https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts with the required information. it should be the first time you can control about your function and your test, so enjoy it. (Exercise 4)

You only have 5 minutes to do this so, don't waste time ‚è∞

Here the files to modify:

- [placeholder.service.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step15/src/app/placeholder.service.ts)

- [placeholder.service.spec.ts](https://github.com/seagomezar/ng-col-angular-ut/blob/step15/src/app/placeholder.service.spec.ts)
